Before the seminar, we will organize a poster session with young economists presenting their research:
- Jean-Paul Tsasa (UQAM)
- Marco Pinchetti (Bank of England) and Andrzej Szczepaniak (Ghent University)
- Ibrahima Diarra (Université Paris-Saclay)
- [Aymeric Ortmans](https://sites.google.com/view/aymericortmans/) (Université Paris-Saclay), *Evolving Monetary Policy in the Aftermath of the Great Recession*
- Peltonen Juho (Université Paris-Saclay)
- Malak Kandoussi (Université Paris-Saclay)

Then, [Enghin Atalay](https://enghinatalay.github.io/) (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia) will present his paper: __Firm Technology Upgrading Through Emerging Work__ *Joint with Sarada*

> We propose a new measure of firms' technology adoption, based on the types of employees they seek. We construct firm-year level measures of emerging and disappearing work using newspaper job ads posted between 1940 and 2000. Firms that post ads for emerging work tend to be younger, more R&D intensive, have faster growth, and are more likely to survive. We develop a model -- consistent with these patterns -- with incumbent job vintage upgrading and firm entry and exit. Our estimated model indicates that 55 percent of upgrading occurs through the entry margin, with incumbents accounting for the remaining 45 percent.
