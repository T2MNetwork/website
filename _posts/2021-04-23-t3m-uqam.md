- Juho Peltonen (Université Paris-Saclay, University of Helsinki), <u>Discount factor shocks and labor market outcomes in the Great Recession</u>

Then, [Enghin Atalay](https://enghinatalay.github.io/) (Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia) will present his paper: <u>Firm Technology Upgrading Through Emerging Work</u>, yoint with Sarada.

> We propose a new measure of firms' technology adoption, based on the types of employees they seek. We construct firm-year level measures of emerging and disappearing work using newspaper job ads posted between 1940 and 2000. Firms that post ads for emerging work tend to be younger, more R&D intensive, have faster growth, and are more likely to survive. We develop a model -- consistent with these patterns -- with incumbent job vintage upgrading and firm entry and exit. Our estimated model indicates that 55 percent of upgrading occurs through the entry margin, with incumbents accounting for the remaining 45 percent.
