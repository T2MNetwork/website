[Giovanni Ricco](https://www.giovanni-ricco.com/) will present his paper: __The Global Transmission of U.S. Monetary Policy__ *Joint with Riccardo Degasperi and Seokki Simon Hong*

> We quantify global US monetary policy spillovers by employing a high-frequency identification and big data techniques, in conjunction with a large harmonised dataset covering 30 economies. We report three novel stylised facts. First, a US monetary policy tightening has large contractionary effects onto both advanced and emerging economies. Second, flexible exchange rates cannot fully insulate domestic economies, due to movements in risk premia that limit central banksâ€™ ability to control the yield curve. Third, financial channels dominate over demand and exchange rate channels in the transmission to real variables, while the transmission via oil and commodity prices determines nominal spillovers.
