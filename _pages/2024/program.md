Each 100 minute session has 3 or 4 papers. Sessions with 4 papers should have 25 minute presentations per paper including questions. Sessions with 3 papers should have 30 minute presentations per paper, plus 2-4 minutes for questions.

The last presenter of each session is the session chair. Session chairs are asked to keep the time to ensure that all papers have their assigned time and sessions do not overrun.
