### Practicalities

The adress for attending the meeting is: [https://cutt.ly/UcUDbxv](https://cutt.ly/UcUDbxv) or [https://vr.t2m.network](vr.t2m.network) It should be already preconfigured in the headsets supplied by ESCP. As a last resort, a fallback option consists in using a modern webbrowser on a recent computer.

During the workshop, do not hesitate to take short breaks to get rid of VR fatigue

The precise autonomy of Oculus Quest II, is unknown, but estimated to be around 2 hours or less. Using the supplied battery charger, it takes around 2.5h to reach full charge. Make sure to charge the device before the conference...

All participants are invited to try the virtual space in advance during the upcoming days.  Do not hesitate to contact pwinant@escp.eu or stenza@escp.eu for any help. We'll be available any time on Monday and early Tuesday and can setup a short meeting with each participant to make sure everything is ok. When testing the VR space, ensure you can:
- move as you wish (trigger to teleport, left joystick to rotate)
- speak and hear correctly
- (optional) draw on a white board

We are using the opensource platform Mozilla Hubs and if needed you can find additional information online: https://hubs.mozilla.com/docs/hubs-controls.html.
