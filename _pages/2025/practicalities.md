Lunches and coffee breaks will all take place in the main hall of the BEM.

## Travel from Paris

Two buses have been booked to transfer all participants, back and forth from the station "Cité Universitaire" RER to the conference venue.

In Paris, the exact meeting spot (see on [map](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TeHYLJZpG5W8Cp6B7)) is on the other side of the street with respect to the station, 50m to the west. Buses will depart at _8h45_ on both days.

It is also possible to reach the conference place using RER B (stopping at Lozere station) ; this involves a little (scenic) walk in the woods from the station to the conference building.

One of our most dedicated organizers will stay near Cité Universitaire after the buses have departed, to help those who have chosen this route (and a few latecomers).

## Dinner

The dinner will take place on Thursday evening at [Le Pavillon Montsouris](https://pavillon-montsouris.paris/). Buses will go there directly after the first conference day.
